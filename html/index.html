      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Christopher Diefenthaler and I am in my final two semesters
        at LCC pursuing my degree in Computer Programming. Currently working
        full time and attending online classes part time, a balanced schedule
        has been very interesting to try and maintin.

        I have three amazingly adorable cats with my fiance, and they are the
        masters of our house. No matter how hard I fight it. We are set to be
        married in October of 2025, just in time for me to graduate.
