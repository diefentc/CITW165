          <h1>Java</h1>
          <p>
            Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming
            language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies
            as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended
            to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA),
            meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that
            support Java without the need for recompilation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems
            and released in 1995. It is one of the most popular programming
            languages in use today, particularly for client-server web
            applications.
          </p>

            Java is a concurrent, class-based, object-oriented language that is

          <h2>Example Code</h2>
          <p>
            I've only had one Java class <b><u>CITP 190 - Intro to Programming in Java</u></b>
            <br>
            Within that class, we created a few programs and I'm highlighting two fo them here
          </p>
          <h3><u>InterestApp</u></h3>
          <p>
            This is a program that takes input from a user and calculates the interest gained 
            on a principal amount over a specified number of years at a given interest rate.
          </p>
          <img src="./img/interestapp_cli.jpg" alt="InterestAPP CLI" />
          <p></p>
          <h3><u>GameApp</u></h3>
          <p>
            In class we created a CLI game that allows the user to play a game of rock, paper, scissors against 
            the computer. The computer randomly selects one of the three options and the program determines the winner
            based on the rules of the game
          </p>
          <img src="./img/gameapp_cli.jpg" alt="Rock Paper Scissors" />

        </div>
        <div id="bottom-right">
          <h2>Note:</h2>
          <p>
            LCC Servers will not allow to have any Java processing performed
            from the server side and I don't believe client side python is
            something that can be accomplished.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, instead of having Java code that is executed here, I will
            provide some screenshots of the code in action and the output that
            is generated from it.
