        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Christopher Diefenthaler, and I am getting ready to
          start my last semester at LCC to obtain my Associates in Business with
          an emphasis on programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been programming in python for about 7 years and currently work
          as a project manager/software developer for a local company where I
          have been employed for the last 10 years. I have a passion for
          programming and creating dynamic and user-friendly applications.

          My mission is to take the complexity out of manual processes and
          provide users with a so called "easy button".<br />
          I strive to create software that is not only functional but also
          intuitive, and I believe that technology should be accessible to
          everyone.
